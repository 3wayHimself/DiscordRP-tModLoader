This mod add a little extra detail of your ingame terraria activity to your discord status.
Still WIP (only 7 biomes detected)

==CURRENTLY CAN'T ENABLE THIS MOD WITHOUT SPECIAL TREATMENT==

a little how to:
1. Get discord-rpc.dll (32 bit) from discordapp/discord-rpc github repository
2. Place it in the same directory as your Terraria.exe
(May still not work)

TO DO:
- somehow create/get managed discord-rpc.dll for easier install
- detect more biomes and areas
- get better screenshoot of biomes
